# RTP Queue Skript
RTPQueue allow players to wait in queue to be teleported

# Description

RTP Queue is a newly made Skript of mine which features a queue system when players type /rtpqueue. It puts the player into a queue (which is sent in chat), and when another player gets in the queue, or when the queue reaches 2, both players get teleported to a random location in the world. It's very useful so that players can fight each other without needing to trust one another because they both get teleported randomly.

I haven't seen much of this idea go around, and hope someone uses it as an inspiration to make this better.

# HELP

It's pretty simple. Not much to config, unless you'd like. If you find any bugs, please join my discord: discord.gg/mcdevs and @ me to report them. I hope there aren't any, as I've tested this myself, but if you come across one, don't hesitate to report it.

# COMMANDS

Player: /rtpqueue

Admins: /rtpqueue-clear (clears the variables, and deletes all the queue data) - mainly used if it gets clogged up, and it ends up breaking. Shouldn't happen often though.
